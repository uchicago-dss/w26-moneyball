# w26-moneyball

With the World Cup coming to the United States next year, this project aims to expand last quarter’s work by analyzing international team performance across qualifiers, friendlies, and prior tournaments. Using match-level statistics such as expected goals, passing accuracy, and defensive efficiency, members will develop a predictive model estimating each nation’s likelihood of winning the World Cup, similar to the approach popularized in the film Moneyball. With the tournament’s newly expanded format, this project seeks to uncover emerging patterns among projected favorites and identify potential underdogs entering through the extended qualification structure, evaluating how these changes may influence competitive outcomes. 

This project welcomes anyone interested in sports or is looking to break into data science/statistics in a low-stakes, collaborative environment.
